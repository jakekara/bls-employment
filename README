Historical, seasonally adjusted BLS employment figures by state

FILES

ALL-1991-2018.csv - spreadsheet containing the data
		  - numbers are in thousands
		  - here's an example: https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet
get_employment.py - run this to download the CSV file
		  - Note: This won't run until you create a config.py file in
		  the directory and set the variable API_KEY to your BLS API key

TODO

I should test that the series IDs correspond to the correct states.
